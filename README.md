# Frog Game
I wanted to try developing simple games in React, and I decided to start with Frogger.

Arrow keys to move ↑↓←→

The objective is to guide your frog to the other frogs across the level.

To start, run `npm start` in the project directory. 

To Do:

-Add cars and hit detection

-Add timer and lives

-Adjust scoring
